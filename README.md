# agilework-space-aws
My AWS dev playground. This is for getting familiar with Terraform
and CloudFormation.

The idea is to start with a VPC, some public and private subnets. In
the beginning the code won't be very dynamic. The goal is to make it
more generic over time, so that different environments can be rolled
out.
